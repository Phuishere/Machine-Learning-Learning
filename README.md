# Machine-Learning-Learning
A repo for my Machine Learning Stuff

## Future development:
1. Traditional ML
- Naive Bayes
- PCA
- SVM
- Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Computer vision
- File formats: ONNX, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Lite-RT
- Quantization, pruning
- Metrics and loss functions
- Medical Imaging:
    + In-depth segmentation
    + 3D Computer Vision
    + MonAI
3. NLP
- Machine Translation
- Multi-agent system
- In-depth RAG (careful evaluation, etc)
- Scalability
4. GAN
5. Auto-encoder
6. Reinforcement learning
